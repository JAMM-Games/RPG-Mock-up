# Welcome to Wyndel!!

## A little about why
Growing up I often watched videos of minecraft letsplay's. Back then the Bedrock edition wasnt a thing and mojang was still a sole entity. I was only able to play when visiting my friends house since I never was able to buy it myself. Regardless I was baffled by the game itself.
I wondered how it worked and I discovered it was made in Java. That didnt mean much to me back then because I didnt know what Java was but now that I am a programmer I have the power to create my own game!

### But... how? 
I don't know the first thing about game development. I figured that Capstone is the perfect time to experiment and learn for myself. So i did, and this is the result. Not to shabby for a first "RPG" and its far from done but im proud of it. I plan on working on this plenty in the future.
I heavily underestimated how development really goes. I dont know if I figured sprites and tiles were just magically be in my project but I never thought about having to design my own tiles and characters. I was so focused on building a game engine.
I learned late in the learn/build process that you if youre making a new engine, you should have the game concept solid and make the engine around the game, not the reverse. (guess which one i did lol) A big set back which halted development for a bit.
Enough about my some of my struggles, What is this project?

## Wyndel(this)
(insert java reference^) 
This is the result of my learning for capstone. Its soley build using Java and Java libraries. (original plans involved using python for scripting Genereative AI into the NPCs limited by deadlines and scoping)
Wyndel is a small RPG made from scratch on its own engine! The game is also build inside the engine, meaning the engine itself is not reuseable for other games. (Originally I was going to develop a game engine that could be reused but I scrapped the idea)
I still need to implament many things. Due to changing the structure of my project 2 weeks into a 5 week development period, I was limited further by scope since the final result I wanted was a functoning game.
I designed everything in the game including characters, I updated some tiles to look more like a youtubers tileset. All characters are purely testing sprites and subject to change.
As the title of the repo states this is a high fidelity mock up of the game I want to create. I plan to develop this game in a bigger engine built using LWJGL. (or i might cave and use unreal or something)
That being said feel free to take this and mess around with it, change it, break it, learn more. I know im still learning, but the process so far has been super fun and I cant wait to learn more.
